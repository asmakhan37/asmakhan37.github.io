        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Asma, and I graduated as a board-certified dentist in Pakistan in 2011. After years of practice, I published research in the American Dental Journal on low-level lasers and their role in reducing pain, contributing to the field of orthodontics. Over time, I realized my growing interest in the technological side of dental sciences and how technology can revolutionize healthcare, particularly in resource-limited countries like Pakistan. This sparked my decision to pursue a major in computer science, as I believe the fusion of healthcare and technology is key to driving future advancements in both fields. I am excited to deepen my knowledge in technology and explore how AI and software development can enhance patient care and healthcare management.</p>
