    <section id="about">
        
        <p>My name is Asma, and I became a certified dentist in Pakistan in 2011. As time passed, I became more interested in how technology can change dental care and healthcare, especially in countries like Pakistan with limited resources. This led me to pursue a degree in computer science because I believe combining healthcare with technology is crucial for the future. Iâ€™m excited to learn more about technology and explore how AI and software can improve patient care and healthcare management.</p>
